      "description": "With a background in software engineering, I've been involved in the development of Java microservices, implementing a hexagonal architecture to enhance modularity and minimize dependencies. My commitment to Clean Code practices and SOLID principles aims to ensure code clarity, supported by my familiarity with Java 17. In the banking sector, I modestly contributed to improving the efficiency of legacy systems. I've also worked with Python in the Odoo framework, focusing on the development of custom modules and API utilization. My experience includes school management applications in Java 8, microservices with Spring Boot and JPA, crafting APIs in Node.js, and working with databases like PostgreSQL and SQL Server. In DevOps, I've played a part in setting up local environments and developed skills in Docker. My approach is centered on continuous learning and contributing practical solutions in diverse technological environments."
