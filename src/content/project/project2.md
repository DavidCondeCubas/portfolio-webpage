A template for a microservices architecture using Java 11, Hexagonal architecture, Lombok, MapStruct, and multimodules can be described as follows:
<br><br>
Microservices Template Description
<br>
<b>Java 11: </b>Utilizes Java 11 as the programming language, taking advantage of its features, improvements, and long-term support.
<br>
<b>Hexagonal Architecture: </b>Adheres to the Hexagonal Architecture (also known as Ports and Adapters or Clean Architecture) for a clear separation of concerns. Core business logic is at the center (hexagon), surrounded by ports (interfaces) for input and output, keeping the business domain independent of external concerns.
<br>
<b>Lombok:</b> Incorporates Lombok to reduce boilerplate code and enhance code readability. Simplifies the creation of Java beans, builders, and other common structures, leading to more concise and maintainable code.
<br>
<b>MapStruct:</b> Integrates MapStruct for seamless and type-safe mapping between objects. Simplifies the transformation of data objects, ensuring efficient and maintainable object mapping.
<br>
<b>Multimodules:</b> Adopts a multimodule project structure for improved organization and modularization. Divides the application into modules, each responsible for a specific functionality, promoting modularity, and ease of maintenance.
<br>
<b>Microservices Design: </b>Designed with a microservices architecture in mind, emphasizing the development of small, independent, and loosely coupled services. Encourages the use of APIs for communication between services, fostering scalability and flexibility.
<br>
<b>API First</b>
<br>
<b>Testing:</b> Promotes a robust testing strategy, incorporating unit tests, integration tests, and possibly end-to-end tests for ensuring the reliability of the microservices.
<br>
<b>Dependency Management: </b>Utilizes a dependency management tool (e.g., Maven or Gradle) to efficiently handle project dependencies and build processes.
